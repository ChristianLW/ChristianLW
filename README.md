## Hi there!

You have somehow made it to my GitHub account.

I doubt there is anything here you will find interesting.

I mainly do small contributions to other repos, fixing language-related issues or adding/changing a minor feature.

My main languages of choice would be Lua and C#, although I also know Java and JavaScript.

I got into programming through the Minecraft mod named [ComputerCraft](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft), made by [dan200](https://github.com/dan200).
