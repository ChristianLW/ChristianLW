## Hi there!

You have somehow made it to my GitHub account.
I doubt there is much here you will find interesting.

I mainly work on my own stuff and sometimes do small contributions to other repos â€“ adding translations, fixing small issues that annoy me, or adding/changing a minor feature.

My main languages of choice would be JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, and Kotlin, but I also know Java and Lua, as well as some basic C.\
I have worked a bit with Python in the past, but I despise its syntax, so I don't work with it if it can be avoided.

I got into programming through the Minecraft mod named [ComputerCraft](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft), made by [dan200](https://github.com/dan200).

I go by the name Bebeu pretty much everywhere online.
